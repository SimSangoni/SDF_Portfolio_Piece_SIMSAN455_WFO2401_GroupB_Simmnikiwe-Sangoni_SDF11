# Project Overview and Learning Reflections

## Overview

This project represents my first attempt at using CSS frameworks, specifically Tailwind CSS. The primary challenge I encountered was centering my responsive page on desktop mode, as well as ensuring my input and button elements were properly aligned after being changed into flex-row at medium screen sizes.

## Learning Reflections

- **Tailwind CSS Experience:** This project marked my first use of CSS frameworks, and I can now appreciate their utility in simplifying and accelerating styling tasks- especially with the dark and light modes- I am a super fan of this and hope I can use it for my portfolio.

- **Challenges Faced:** My main struggle revolved around centering the page in desktop mode, and sizing as well as the repetitiveness of it, I assumed a lot of stuff, which left me with bugs.

- **Documentation Dependency:** A question arose regarding the necessity to install Tailwing like how we were taught on the YouTube video for every project, the reliance on the installation documentation was a bit worrisome for me- even the installation scared me a bit. I aim to explore ways to streamline and simplify this (please advise).

- **Styling Line Length:** I encountered difficulties in managing line length and I would like to explore techniques or extensions to make lines shorter or span multiple lines.

- **Prioritizing Learning:** Due to time constraints, I had to learn on the go. I feel like I need to dedicate time to Scrimba courses and consolidate my understanding of CSS frameworks, then perhaps add apply this new found knowledge to my portfolio.

## Next Steps

Over the weekend, I plan to invest time in Scrimba courses- specifically Bootstrap and CSS, ensuring a deeper understanding of Tailwind CSS and CSS styling principles.
