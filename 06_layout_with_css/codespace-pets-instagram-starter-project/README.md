# Learning Reflections README 

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview

I developed a copy of an Instagram profile page, emphasizing CSS layout and design. I implemented diverse CSS methods to attain a responsive and visually appealing layout that performs effectively on various devices.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I learnt to use Flexbox and Grid, I particularly enjoyed the grid areas, but I need more practice when it comes to UI design as whole.
- **Responsive Design**: This also went relatively well for a first attempt, but it would have been better if the actual images adjusted themselves, instead of the number of columns in my grid.
- **Styling Elements**: I think I am fairly confident with these, as they are mostly related to designers choice.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: I did have an issue with this, as I wanted the images to shrink, and the number of rows and columns to be consistent throughout.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: I am fairly confident with these, but Hover is my favourite.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: General UX design and the interlinking of my Flexbox and Grid
- **Code Optimization**: Neater and more interconected code so that when I change one section, all relevant parties conform too.
- **Creative Design Choices**: This is something learnt over time.

#### Overall Learning Experience

It was tough as I mostly winged it, I did not look of previous examples. The only inspiration I used was mt instagram profile picture, the LMS notes and some inspo from Pinterest for aesthetics.
